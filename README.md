# SpagBol Programming Language
This programming language is designed to be as confusing as possible to write. The goal of this project is to create a code which will be difficult to decrypt, therefore improving the reader's logical thinking.
The structure of this project along with large chunks of code has been taken from the YouTube series: Create a programming language by lanertson
